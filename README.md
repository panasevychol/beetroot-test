# beetroot-test

This is a simple web application that requests an API for some old games info and allows user to search by names. It's written in Python using Flask.

To run application please install Flask by executing the command...
```pip install flask```

...and then launch it
```python run.py```

Visit `http://localhost:5000/` to access the application interface.

The first start can take a pretty long time because all game data will be downloaded.
